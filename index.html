                <p id="intro">Hello! My name is Amberlie Pereira, and I am a Concordia University student who is presently enrolled in the co-op programme for computer science.
                     When I first started playing video games in 2011, I developed a fascination for coding, and ever since then, I have been practising coding in my spare time.<br><br>
                     I am a quick learner and enjoy adding to my knowledge and skill set. I enjoy working both independently and in teams, and I consistently aim to provide excellent work. 
                     I've chosen to pursue a career in computer science because of my love of the subject.<br><br>
                     On my website, I will showcase my projects and highlight the skills I have developed throughout my studies and personal projects. 
                     I hope that my passion for coding and my experience will make me a valuable addition to any team I work with.<br><br>
                     Thank you for taking the time to read my about me section, and I look forward to hearing from you soon.
                      </p>

        <div class = "projects">
            <h1 id= "projects">Projects</h1>
                <p>Here are the following projects that I have completed:</p>
                <ul id = "ul2">
                    <li><a href = "#Website">Website</a></li>
                    <li><a href = "#Scratch">Scratch Game</a></li>
                </ul>
         </div>
         <div class = "list">
            <h3 id = "Website">Website</h3>
                <p>This website is my first project. I created this website independently during my personal time using HTML and CSS. 
                    I developed my skills in these languages by self-learning, and this project is a result of my dedication and hard work.<br><br>
                    However, I am always striving to improve my skills, and I plan to further enhance my knowledge by taking the SOEN 287 class during the summer. 
                    This class will give me the opportunity to gain a deeper understanding of HTML and CSS and help me develop even better projects in the future.<br><br>
                    Overall, this project showcases my ability to create a functional website using HTML and CSS, and it is a testament to my passion for coding and web development. 
                    I hope you enjoy exploring my website and seeing the projects I have created!

            <h3 id = "Scratch">Scratch Game</h3>
                <p>Riley's Kitchen Adventure is a game that I created using Scratch, along with a friend, for a video game design class at Vanier Cegep. 
                    This game tells the story of a mouse named Riley, whose goal is to collect fruit in order to unlock barriers and reach the cheese to advance to the next level.<br><br>
                    To add a layer of difficulty, there is a time limit and a health bar. The health bar decreases each time the player hits a fork, and it can be regained by collecting fruit. 
                    Clocks are also included in the game, which grant the player more time. The game features background music and sound effects, which enhances the overall gaming experience.<br><br>
                    The game can be played by moving the mouse using the arrow keys on the keyboard. The player can jump and move up, down, left, and right to navigate through the game.<br><br>
                    Riley's Kitchen Adventure is a significant project for me as it was the first project I ever created, and it marked the beginning of my coding journey. This project gave me the opportunity 
                    to apply my creativity and problem-solving skills to design a fun and engaging game. It also taught me the basics of game development, and it has inspired me to continue exploring new ideas and creating exciting projects.<br><br>
                    Below is a video of what the game looks like and how it works.
